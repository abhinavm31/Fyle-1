A REST API (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface (API or web API) that conforms to the constraints of REST 
architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services. REST stands for representational state transfer and was created by 
computer scientist Roy Fielding.

REST is a set of architectural constraints, not a protocol or a standard. API developers can implement REST in a variety of ways.

When a client request is made via a RESTful API, it transfers a representation of the state of the resource to the requester or endpoint. This 
information, or representation, is delivered in one of several formats via HTTP: JSON (Javascript Object Notation), HTML, XLT, Python, PHP, or 
plain text. JSON is the most generally popular programming language to use because, despite its name, itâ€™s language-agnostic, as well as readable 
by both humans and machines. 

Something else to keep in mind: Headers and parameters are also important in the HTTP methods of a RESTful API HTTP request, as they contain 
important identifier information as to the request's metadata, authorization, uniform resource identifier (URI), caching, cookies, and more. There 
are request headers and response headers, each with their own HTTP connection information and status codes.
